# DATA

```{r}
df <- read.csv("../db/players_22.csv", encoding = "UTF-8")
kable(t(head(df,3)), "html") %>% kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped","hover", "condensed"), font_size = 8) %>% scroll_box(width = "100%")
```

Ther are 110 columns and 19239 observations on the data.
```{r}
dim(df)
```

Now we gonna check some more details about data with `DataExplorer` package.

```{r}
# Check data structure with introduce()
kable(introduce(df), "html") %>% kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped","hover", "condensed")) %>% scroll_box(width = "100%")
```
```{r}
# Now we will plot it with plot_intro()
plot_intro(df, title = "Data Structure of database")
```
```{r}
plot_missing(df, missing_only = TRUE, title = "Percentage of Missing Features")
```

# Data Prep.

First, we need to deal with missing features in ours dataset.

## Missing Values

### Free agent player & retire player

Since **free agent** player didn't play for any clubs. Therefore, some features (`club_contract_valid_unitl`, `club_jersy_number`, `league_level`, `club_team_id`, `wage_eur`, `value_eur`) will be null. 

```{r}
df %>% 
  filter(is.na(club_team_id) &
          is.na(club_jersey_number) &
          is.na(league_level) &
          is.na(club_team_id) &
          is.na(wage_eur) &
          is.na(value_eur)) %$%
  unique(club_name)
```

However, we can see from graph above that there are some non-free agent player that didn't have value. We also can assume that these old players value equal to 0. 

```{r}
df %>% 
  filter(is.na(value_eur) & club_name != "") %$%
  kable(head(.),"html") %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped","hover", "condensed"), font_size = 8) %>% 
  scroll_box(width = "100%")
```

Fill the missing values

```{r}
# Fill the missing values
df$club_contract_valid_until[is.na(df$club_contract_valid_until)] <- 0
df$club_jersey_number[is.na(df$club_jersey_number)] <- 0

# league_level is ordinal variable which 1 is the highest league and 5 is lowest league
# Since, these player are free agent and didn't play in any league at the moment so we assign 6 to them
df$league_level[is.na(df$league_level)] <- 6

# club_team_id run from 1 to 115820. we will assing 0 to the free agent
df$club_team_id[is.na(df$club_team_id)] <- 0

df$wage_eur[is.na(df$wage_eur)] <- 0
df$value_eur[is.na(df$value_eur)] <- 0
```

```{r}
plot_missing(df, missing_only = TRUE, title = "Percentage of Missing Features")
```

### Release Clause

Not all player have release clause. So, it natural to have some missng `release_clause_eur`.

```{r}
df %>% 
  filter(is.na(release_clause_eur)) %$%
  kable(head(.),"html") %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped","hover", "condensed"), font_size = 8) %>% 
  scroll_box(width = "100%")
```
The player with missing `release_clause_eur` are player whom didn't have release clause so it equal to 0.
```{r}
df$release_clause_eur[is.na(df$release_clause_eur)] <- 0
```

```{r}
plot_missing(df, missing_only = TRUE, title = "Percentage of Missing Features")
```

### Goalkeeping player

From the data we can see that there are _11.08%_ of player which missing basic features such as `physic`, `defending`, `dribbling`, `passing`, `shooting`, and `pace`. On the other hand, there are _88.92%_ of player who missing `goalkeeping_speed`. If we combine these two numbers we will got _100%_. Therefore, There might be two group of player **Goalkeeper** and **Non-Goalkeeper**.

```{r}
# Check non-goalkeeper group
df %>% 
  filter(is.na(goalkeeping_speed)) %$%
  unique(club_position)
```

As we expect these group of players are **Non-Goalkeeper**. we can fill `goalkeeping_speed` with 0 since it not related with their position.

```{r}
df$goalkeeping_speed[is.na(df$goalkeeping_speed)] <- 0
```

```{r}
# Check goalkeeper group
df %>% 
  filter(is.na(physic) &
         is.na(defending) &
         is.na(dribbling) &
         is.na(passing) &
         is.na(shooting)& 
         is.na(pace)) %$% 
  unique(club_position)
```

Apparently there are not only `GK` in these group need keep investigating.

```{r}
df %>% 
  filter(is.na(physic) &
         is.na(defending) &
         is.na(dribbling) &
         is.na(passing) &
         is.na(shooting)& 
         is.na(pace)) %>% 
  filter(club_position %in% c("SUB", "RES", "")) %$%
  unique(player_positions)
```

After more investigation the player with `club_position` equal to `SUB`, `RES`, and `""` in second group also a *Goalkeeper*. and we can fill these features with 0.

```{r}
df$physic[is.na(df$physic)] <- 0
df$defending[is.na(df$defending)] <- 0
df$dribbling[is.na(df$dribbling)] <- 0
df$passing[is.na(df$passing)] <- 0
df$shooting[is.na(df$shooting)] <-0
df$pace[is.na(df$pace)] <- 0
```

```{r}
plot_missing(df, missing_only = TRUE, title = "Percentage of Missing Features")
```

### National Team player

The missing value of `nation_jersey_number` and `nation_team_id` is a majority of player who not selected in their national team. we will fill this with 0.
```{r}
df$nation_jersey_number[is.na(df$nation_jersey_number)] <- 0
df$nation_team_id[is.na(df$nation_team_id)] <- 0
```

```{r}
plot_intro(df, title = "Data Structure of database")
```

With this we deal with all missing value and reach tidydata.
```{r}
# save df into .Rdata format
save(df, file = "../output/fifa_22_tidydata_raw.Rdata")
list.files(path = "../output")
```

## Data Manipulation

### Unnecessary Features

```{r}
df %<>% select(-player_url, -long_name, -real_face, -ls, -st, -rs, -lw, -lf, -cf, -rf, -rw, -lam, -cam, -ram, -lm, -lcm, -cm, -rcm, -rm, -lwb, -ldm, -cdm, -rdm, -rwb, -lb, -lcb, -cb, -rcb, -rb, -gk)
kable(t(head(df)), "html") %>% kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped","hover", "condensed"), font_size = 8) %>% scroll_box(width = "100%")
```

## Stacked columns

`work_rate`, `player_tags`, and `player_traits` are stacked columns. This mean in each columns there might be more than one values in it. 

```{r}
# Unstacked work_rate

df <- df %$%
  cSplit(., 'work_rate', sep= "/", type.convert = FALSE) %>% 
  rename(
    work_rate_att = work_rate_1,
    work_rate_dff = work_rate_2 )
```

```{r}
kable(t(head(df,3)), "html") %>% kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped","hover", "condensed"), font_size = 8) %>% scroll_box(width = "100%")
```

for feature like `player_tags`, and `player_traits` we need to one-hot encode them.

```{r}
one_hot <- function(x) {
  map_df(x, table) %>% 
    mutate_all(as.integer) %>% 
    mutate_all(replace_na, 0L)
}
df$player_traits <- str_remove_all(df$player_traits, "\\(AI\\)")

df$player_tags[df$player_tags == ""] <- "#No_Tags"
df$player_traits[df$player_traits == ""] <- "No Traits"


df %<>% 
  mutate(one_hot(strsplit(player_tags, ", "))) %>% 
  mutate(one_hot(strsplit(player_traits, ", "))) %>% 
  select(-player_tags, -player_traits) 

df %$% 
  kable(t(head(.,3)), "html") %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped","hover", "condensed"), font_size = 8) %>% 
  scroll_box(width = "100%")

```

one player can plays multiple position. However, as we can see the first postion in `player_postion` is there main position. Therefore, we are going to make it their only position.

```{r}
df$player_positions <- sapply(strsplit(df$player_positions, ", "), `[`, 1)

defence <- c("CB", "RB", "LB", "LWB", "RWB", "LCB", "RCB")
midfielder <- c("CM", "CDM","CAM","LM","RM", "LAM", "RAM", "LCM", "RCM", "LDM", "RDM")

df %<>% mutate(Class = if_else(player_positions %in% "GK", "GK",
                                 if_else(player_positions %in% defence, "DEF",
                                         if_else(player_positions %in% midfielder, "MID", "FWD"))))

rm(defence, midfielder)
```



Now we finished cleaning our data and can begins ours analysis.
```{r}
# save df into .Rdata format
save(df, file = "../output/fifa_22_tidydata_cleaned.Rdata")
list.files(path = "../output")
```

# EDA

```{r}
load("../output/fifa_22_tidydata_cleaned.Rdata")

  scroll_box(width = "100%")
```
```{r, message= FALSE, warning= FALSE}

                                                 "UK", nationality_name)) %>%
               count(Nationality, name = "Number of Player") %>%
               rename(region = Nationality) %>%

```

There are 163 countries in the database and European Countries have most player. The `England` has the most player in the game with 1719 players, following with `Germany` and `Spain` with 1214 and 1086 players.

```{r}

```

ggplot(foots, aes(fill=preferred_foot, values=p_player))+
  geom_waffle(n_rows= 10, colour= "White") +
  scale_fill_manual(name= NULL,
                    values = c("grey50", "grey"),
                    labels= c("Left", "Right")) +
  ggtitle("Left vs Right foot", subtitle = "There are 24 lefty out of every 100 players") +
  coord_equal() +
  theme_fivethirtyeight() +
  theme(panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
        axis.text.y = element_blank(), 
        axis.text.x = element_blank())
```

## Player Overall
```{r, echo=FALSE, results= 'hide'}
summary(df$overall)
sd(df$overall)
```

Player rating are normally distributed in FIFA 22, with a mean of 65.77 and standard deviation of 6.88.

```{r, message= FALSE, warning= FALSE}
df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = overall)) +
  geom_histogram(color= "white", fill="darkgrey") +
  ggtitle("Player Ratings Are Normally Distributed", subtitle = "The mean can be used as a measure of central tendancy") +
  theme_fivethirtyeight() +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_blank())
```

Now we can check the distibution of each leage.

```{r, message= FALSE, warning= FALSE, results='hide'}
top_league <- df %>% 
  filter(league_level == 1) %>% 
  group_by(league_name) %>% 
  summarise(avg_rating = mean(overall)) %>% 
  filter(avg_rating >= 70) %>% 
  select(league_name)

summ <- df %>% 
  filter(league_name %in% top_league$league_name) %>% 
  group_by(league_name) %>% 
  summarise(avg_rating = mean(overall),
            n_player = n(),
            avg_age = mean(age))

top_league_player <- df %>% 
  filter(league_name %in% top_league$league_name)

options(repr.plot.width = 12, repr.plot.heigh = 8)

ggplotly(ggplot() + 
  geom_histogram(top_league_player, mapping = aes(overall, fill= league_name), color= "white", fill="darkgrey") +
  geom_vline(summ, mapping = aes(xintercept = avg_rating), size = 0.5, color="red") +
  geom_text(summ, mapping = aes(x = avg_rating-5, y= 100, label= round(avg_rating, digits = 2))) +
  facet_wrap(league_name~.) +
  theme_fivethirtyeight() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom", axis.text.y = element_blank()) +
  labs(y = element_blank(), x= "Overall Rating" , title = "Rating Distribution of Player in Top Leagues", subtitle = "Overall rating distribution and average overall rating of all top leagues"))
```

The average overall rating of each league is closely related with how skilled player in the league, the higher the average overall rating - the higher the skill. Apparently, player in `Campeonato Brasileiro Série A`, `Czech Republic Gambrinus Liga`, and `Ukrainian Premier League` from Brazil, Czech, and Ukrain are as skilled as player in `German 1. Budesliga` or `French Ligue 1` from German and France and player in `Spain Primera Division` from Spain is the most skilled one. 

## Age vs Overall Rating

```{r}
df %>% 
  filter(!player_positions == "GK") %>% 
  group_by(age) %>% 
  summarise(Potential = mean(potential),
            Overall = mean(overall)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = age)) +
  geom_line(aes(y=Overall), color= "grey50", size=1)+
  ggtitle("Average rating is flaten over the years", subtitle = "Player ratings tend not to get better after the age of 30")+
  theme_fivethirtyeight()
```

As we can see the average overall rating is flaten over the ages and drop sharply after 40.

```{r, message= FALSE, warning= FALSE}

df %>% 
  filter(!Class == "GK") %>% 
  group_by(Class, age) %>% 
  summarise(Rating = mean(overall)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x= age, y= Rating, group= Class)) +
  geom_line(size = 1, color= "grey50") +
  xlim(15, 45) +
  ggtitle("Rating over the ages by position class") +
  theme_fivethirtyeight() +
  facet_wrap(~ Class, ncol=1) +
  theme(strip.background = element_rect(fill= "darkgrey"), strip.text = element_text(color= "white", face= "bold"))
  
```

With this relationship is explored by the major position groups, we can see that defender ratings tend to beging their decline earliest at around 33 years of age, while the decline starts somewhere closer to 35 for both attackers and midfielders.

## When player are reaching their potential

```{r}
df %>% 
  group_by(age) %>% 
  summarise(Potential = mean(potential),
            Overall = mean(overall)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = age)) +
  geom_line(aes(y=Potential), color= "purple", size=1, linetype= "dashed")+
  geom_line(aes(y=Overall), color= "grey50", size=1)+
  annotate("text", x= 30, y=73, label="Potential meets overall\ntalent at 29 years old", color= "grey50") +
  ggtitle("Potential And Overall Talent Converges", subtitle = "The average ratings were taken for each age")+
  theme_fivethirtyeight()
```
 It appear that the player potential and player over all converge around when they are 29.
 
```{r, message= FALSE, warning= FALSE}

pearson_cor_overall <- cbind(cor_colnames, pearson_cor_overall) %>% arrange(desc(`.`))

  kable((head(.,10)), "html") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped","hover", "condensed"), font_size = 8) %>%

These are 10 highly correalated attrs with `overall`.
